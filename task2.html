          <h4>About Muhammed Ali</h4>
          <p>
            Muhammad Ali (born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr.) was an American
            professional boxer and social activist. A global cultural icon,
            widely known by the nickname "the Greatest", he is often regarded as
            the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time. He held the Ring
            magazine heavyweight title from 1964 to 1970, was the undisputed
            champion from 1974 to 1978, and was the WBA and Ring heavyweight
            champion from 1978 to 1979. In 1999, he was named Sportsman of the
            Century by Sports Illustrated and the Sports Personality of the
            Century by the BBC.
